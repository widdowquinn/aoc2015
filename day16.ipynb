    "\n",
    "So, to avoid sending the card to the wrong person, you need to figure out which Aunt Sue (which you conveniently number 1 to 500, for sanity) gave you the gift. You open the present and, as luck would have it, good ol' Aunt Sue got you a My First Crime Scene Analysis Machine! Just what you wanted. Or needed, as the case may be.\n",

    "    cars, presumably by exhaust or gasoline or something.\n",
    "    perfumes, which is handy, since many of your Aunts Sue wear a few kinds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, many of your Aunts Sue have many of these. You put the wrapping from the gift into the MFCSAM. It beeps inquisitively at you a few times and then prints out a message on ticker tape:\n",
